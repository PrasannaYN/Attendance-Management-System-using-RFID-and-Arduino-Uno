Attendance Management System using RFID and Arduino Uno
Abstract:
Automates attendance tracking using RFID technology.
Efficient and cost-effective solution for educational institutions, corporate offices, and healthcare.
Reduces manual effort, improves accuracy, and ensures real-time updates.
1. Introduction:
RFID technology automates attendance tracking, minimizing human errors.
Adaptable to various industries (education, corporate, healthcare).
Ensures accurate, real-time attendance data.
2. Problem Statement:
Time-Consuming: Manual methods are slow and labor-intensive.
Prone to Errors: Human mistakes affect attendance reliability.
Lack of Real-Time Data: Traditional methods donâ€™t provide immediate feedback.
Security Risks: Paper or manual systems are vulnerable to fraud.
3. Objectives:
Automate attendance tracking using RFID.
Ensure accuracy with real-time updates.
Provide easy integration and user accessibility.
Increase security and minimize fraud.
Generate automated attendance reports.
4. Proposed Solution:
